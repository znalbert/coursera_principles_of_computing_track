# An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python

This repository houses my projects for both parts of Coursera's course [An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1) created by Rice University. This course aims to teach programming by having students create games using Python.

## Playing the games

Go to any folder in this repository, click the link to the project in the README, and click the "Play" button in the upper left corner on the projects Codeskulptor page.  It'll look like this:

## More Info About the Course

### Codeskulptor

For this course one of the professors at Rice University created an in-browser IDE called [Codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/).

### SimpleGUI for Creating Frames and GUIs

Starting with the second project we're creating projects with frames and GUIs. Since we're using an in-browser IDE, they've created SimpleGUI, which is a graphical module akin to TkInter for the platform.
