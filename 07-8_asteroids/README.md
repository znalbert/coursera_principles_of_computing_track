# Asteroids

This was my "Asteroids" submission for Coursera's Intro to Interactive Programming in Python course. Use the arrow keys to control the spaceship and spacebar to shoot.

## How to Play

(TL;DR - Click the play button in the upper left [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_N61SJbXs3w_15.py).)

Currently, this code is intended for use with Coursera's [Codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) Python interpreter, and you can play my version [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_N61SJbXs3w_15.py). You just have to hit the "play" icon in the upper left corner.

After hitting play, fly your spaceship with the directional keys and fire at the asteroids with the spacebar.  Make your three lives count!

## Learning Objectives for This Project

#### Basic game physics, sprites, Sets and animation

This was the final game project split over two weeks. The first submission just focus on the basic physics of getting sprites moving and wrapping around the screen. The second part included working with putting items into sets and figuring how to remove them on collisions as well as the animations for the explosions.
