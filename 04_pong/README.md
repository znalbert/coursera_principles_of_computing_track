# Pong

This was my "Pong" submission for Coursera's Intro to Interactive Programming in Python course. "W" and "S" keys control the left paddle and the up and down arrow keys control the right one.

## How to Play

(TL;DR - Click the play button in the upper left [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_DdmW3XS8ca_2.py).)

Currently, this code is intended for use with their [Codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) Python interpreter, and you can play my version [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_DdmW3XS8ca_2.py). You just have to hit the "play" icon in the upper left corner.

After hitting that button you'll get a pop-up window in which the game takes place. The game starts immediately. So, be ready. Use the `W` and `S` keys to control the left paddle and th `Up` and `Down` to control the right one.

## Learning Objectives for This Project

#### Lists, keyboard input, the basics of modeling motion

This was a fun project because it felt like the first "real" game. In it we used lists to track the x and y positions of the ball and paddles, used keyboard input to control the paddles, and generated motion by giving items velocity values.
