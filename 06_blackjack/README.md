# Blackjack

This was my "Blackjack" submission for Coursera's Intro to Interactive Programming in Python course. This was the first project in the course to implement object oriented programming.

## How to Play

(TL;DR - Click the play button in the upper left [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_2LHNvJJRAp_8.py).)

Currently, this code is intended for use with Coursera's [Codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) Python interpreter, and you can play my version [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_2LHNvJJRAp_8.py). You just have to hit the "play" icon in the upper left corner.

After hitting "play" the game is in session.  You can choose to hit or stand, but if you hit "Deal" without either busting or standing you automatically lose a dollar.

## Learning Objectives for This Project

#### Classes and object-oriented programming

For this project I had to create classes for the cards, hand, and deck. After that, I made functions for playing Blackjack that utilized the features of the classes.
