# Guess the Number

This was my "Guess the Number" submission for Coursera's Intro to Interactive Programming in Python course. It involves creating a simple interface with their SimpleGUI module in order to create a mini-game in which the player tries to guess a random number selected by the computer.  The player can play one of two versions in which the number is either in between 1 to 100 or between 1 to 1000.

## How to Play

(TL;DR - Click the play button in the upper left [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_71DF9qwVQ5_1.py).)

Currently, this code is intended for use with their [Codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) Python interpreter, and you can play my version [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_71DF9qwVQ5_1.py). You just have to hit the "play" icon in the upper left corner.

Once you've hit the "play" button, you'll have a window pop up and the game will be started. In the window you'll have the option to reset the game to a different range or enter a guess until you run out of guesses, at which point the game will reset with the same range. While this course creates a frame, it prints messages to the console to let the user know about their guesses.

## Learning Objectives for This Project

This is an early project that teaches about global variables and creating frames.
