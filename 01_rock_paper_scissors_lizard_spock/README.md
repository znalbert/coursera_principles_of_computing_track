# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

This was my Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock submission for Coursera's Intro to Interactive Programming in Python course. It's a pretty simple program that models the game Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock, which is essentially Rock-Paper-Scissors but with two more options in order to make the game more interesting. In this version the player selects one of the five choices and the computer randomly selects a choice, after which the game prints out the results.

## How to Play

(TL;DR - Click the play button in the upper left [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_ACCNSin33D_2.py).)

Currently, this code is intended for use with their [Codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) Python interpreter, and you can play my version [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_ACCNSin33D_2.py). You just have to hit the "play" icon in the upper left corner.

Right now, the program just runs five times, with the player selecting one of each of the choices, and the computer randomly selecting a choice as well.  It prints out the results in the window on the right.

## Learning Objectives for This Project

This being the first project it was pretty simple and straight forward. You have functions using helper functions to determine that the user has given a valid input and then runs the game using modular arithmetic to determine the winner, which is then printed to the console.
