# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

This was my Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock submission for Coursera's Intro to Interactive Programming in Python course. It's a pretty simple program that models the game Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock, which is essentially Rock-Paper-Scissors but with two more options in order to make the game more interesting. In this version the player selects one of the five choices and the computer randomly selects a choice, after which the game prints out the results.

Currently, this code is intended for use with their [Codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) Python interpreter, and you can play my version [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_bR8hsxFWu0_14.py). You just have to hit the "play" icon in the upper left corner.  I may try to convert this project to work with tkinter or JavaScript if I find the time.
