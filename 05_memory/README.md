# Memory

This was my "Memory" submission for Coursera's Intro to Interactive Programming in Python course. In this game you click a card to reveal a number and try to match it to the same number under another card.

## How to Play

(TL;DR - Click the play button in the upper left [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_nQF9YQUa7lGwEpQ_1.py).)

Currently, this code is intended for use with Coursera's [Codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) Python interpreter, and you can play my version [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_nQF9YQUa7lGwEpQ_1.py). You just have to hit the "play" icon in the upper left corner.

After hitting "play" the game is in session. Click cards to reveal their number and try to match all the pairs in as few clicks as possible!

## Learning Objectives for This Project

#### Mouse input, list methods

In this project we used mouse input to reveal cards, and kept track of card states using list methods.
