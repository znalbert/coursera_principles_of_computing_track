# Stopwatch: The Game

This was my "Stopwatch: The Game" submission for Coursera's Intro to Interactive Programming in Python course. Essentially, the goal is to try to score by stopping the stopwatch on a whole second.

## How to Play

(TL;DR - Click the play button in the upper left [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_DdmW3XS8ca_2.py).)

Currently, this code is intended for use with their [Codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) Python interpreter, and you can play my version [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_DdmW3XS8ca_2.py). You just have to hit the "play" icon in the upper left corner.

After hitting that button you'll get a pop-up window in which the game takes place. Hit start when you're ready to go, and you score by hitting stop on a whole second. Hitting reset will reset the time and score.

## Learning Objectives for This Project

This was the first project that didn't take place in the console. We had to setup a timer, buttons to control the timer, and event handlers for the timer. We also had to format the time with modular arithmetic and have it displayed correctly on the canvas.
